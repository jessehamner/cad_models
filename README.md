# OpenSCAD Models for 3D Printing

Each of these folders is a separate project I've created for my own use, whether to enhance the functionality of an existing product or to repair something. 
If you find these useful, enjoy.
If you want to modify the code, feel free: I like OpenSCAD's language and I haven't felt constrained by its command syntax, since most of my projects are simple.

All of these models print fine with filament on my Prusa 3D printer. I've used PLA and PETG for all of them.

## what's Here

- A replacement cap for the Zefal HP "Husky" bike pump. Mine finally broke after 30 years so I designed a replacement
- A case for the Inovato Quadra set-top box, with several variants
- A hanging pocket to hold an Apple Magic Mouse 2 so that it can be recharged without resting upside down on your desk
- A tool organizer for several small tools I carry around each day (EDC / everyday carry)

Naturally, more stuff is coming. But you have to start sharing somewhere.
